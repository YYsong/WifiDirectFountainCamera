//For train, there should be a native SvcCaptureEngine class, responding to this Java class. Video CC will call native SvcCaptureEngine directly. 
//But I believe in the future, the Video CC will become Java code. So a nice designed Java SvcCaptureEngine will be there.
public class SvcCaptureEngine {
	
//Method:
	//1. set SVC encode param
	
	//2. request key frame
	
	//3. start SVC encode
	 
	//4. stop SVC encode
	
	//5. get codec type
	
	//6. set camera device
	
	//7. start camera capture
	
	//8. stop camera capture
	
	//9. set camera surface
